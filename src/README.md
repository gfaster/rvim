## Rvim

My vim-like implementation written in Rust

## Features

- basic word navigation using `wWbBeEhjkl`
- Relative line numbering

## Why?

1. Because it's a good exercise
2. Because saying that I use my own handbuilt editor is a massive flex
3. Because Lua is bloat - if you want to configure plugins and the like, you can recompile
